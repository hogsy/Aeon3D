# hg3d

This is a fork of Genesis3D 1.1 that's updated to compile on current platforms w/ current compilers.

## License

The original engine was under the `GENESIS3D PUBLIC LICENSE`, however, it appears the licence has since been waivered by Genesis Technologies [here](https://www.genesis3d.com/licensing.html).

> Genesis3D 1.x is abandonware and the principal stakeholders are gone. You may use it free of license restrictions.

In such a case, I've opted to release this under MIT, though you can find the original license [here](license.old).
